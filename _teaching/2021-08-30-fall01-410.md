Course Description
======
The course covers environmental policy problems from the perspective of international political economy. Fundamentally, political economy of the environment asks: who wins and who loses in environmental decisions, why, and how are those decisions made? Through the development of in-depth case studies of environmental problems, students explore debates about the nature of environmental problems, the use and abuse of scientific evidence, and the costs and benefits of potential solutions. Particular attention will be paid to effectively managing group dynamics, practicing critical thinking, and building strong research and communication skills.

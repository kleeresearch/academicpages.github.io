2021-2024 [DSI Fellow](https://dsi.udel.edu/fellows/) & [DSI+AICoE Hackaton 2023](https://dsi.udel.edu/events/dsi-symposium-2023/hackathon/) Mentor 


What is a Hackathon?
A hackathon is an event where a group of people, typically including software developers, designers, and other technology enthusiasts, come together to collaborate on a project, usually over a period of a few days. The participants work intensively to develop new software, hardware, or other technology-based solutions to address a specific problem or challenge.

The DS-AI Hackathon is a 3-day hackathon hosted by The Data Science Institute (DSI) and AI Center of Excellence (AICoE) at UD . We aim to bring together the UD community and local industry partners to work collaboratively towards solving problems in their codes, data or applications. Data Science, AI and HPC research are all welcome!

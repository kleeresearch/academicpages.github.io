Abstract
======
Despite of widely known environmentally-friendliness of renewable energy, local residents have opposed to installation projects of renewable energy facilities in South Korea, mostly because of benefit distribution problems. Accordingly, in 2017, the Moon Jae-in government in South Korea announced to implement new renewable energy policies in order to promote local participation in various and large-scale renewable energy projects. However, no case study has been conducted on the impact of the Benefit Sharing Mechanism (BSM) with regard to renewable energy projects in South Korea. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine the positive effects and problematic conditions of adopting the BSM into renewable energy projects focusing on the case of onshore wind farms in Jeju island to drive a high level of public acceptance and policy implications. Interviews were conducted with seven representatives living in three villages, Samdal-ri, Gasi-ri, Hangwon-ri, in Jeju island. Through this study, three positive effects and four problematic conditions of the BSM came to be identified. The result of this study implies importance of internalizing sufficient damage rewards into the BSM, considering local residents as major stakeholders, utilizing electricity subsidy, expanding beneficiary scope, and preparing platform or guidelines for establishing place-based Benefit Sharing Mechanism in South Korea.
